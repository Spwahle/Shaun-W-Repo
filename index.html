    <h3>Background:</h3>
      <p> As a wanna-be developer I'm starting to see the complexity of higher languages.
      It's interesting to think that from my phone to intense data systems are at their
      basic level just binary. I've been in the Food Technology industry for 5 years now.
      Although, I find it interesting and mostly fufilling it still leaves me mostly unchallenged.
      I find that coding so far has really engaged me in many ways. I really enjoy it! </p>

      <h3>Hobbies and Interests:</h3>
      <p> Over the years, I've found myself lucky enough to find a few passions in my life. The most important to
        is cooking and enjoying good food! Cooking to me is relaxing. I also throughly enjoy traveling as much as
        but there are monetary issues with that at time. The reason I want to be a developer is to travel more! I'm
        also a fan of video games, long distance running, brewing beer and going to burning man events!</p>
