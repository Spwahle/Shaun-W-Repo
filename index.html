        <p>Student/Food Technologist</p>
        <p> As a wanna-be developer I'm starting to see the complexity of higher languages.
          It's interesting to think that from my phone to intense data systems are at their
          basic level just binary. I've been in the Food Technology industry for 5 years now.
          Although, I find it interesting and mostly fufilling it still leaves me mostly unchallenged.
          I find that coding so far has really engaged me in many ways. I really enjoy it! </p>
