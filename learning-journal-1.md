Learning Journal 1

Today I really feel like I grasped the concepts pretty easily. I do feel like I've been reviewing the very basic HTML, CSS and JS for the last few weeks. However, something about Brian's lecture really made me feel more confident in my knowledge.
I did have a few issues with the .toUpperCase and .toLowerCase but I was able to figure it!

Also I was able to clone and push git. However, I don't think think I quite understand what I was doing. I was just following instructions though. I'm sure with more usage I'll be more comfortable.
